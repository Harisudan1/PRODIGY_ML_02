# PRODIGY_ML_02
Implemented K-means clustering for customer segmentation based on purchase history attributes such as Annual Income and Spending Score. Utilized scikit-learn and matplotlib for clustering analysis and visualization.

Implemented K-means clustering for customer segmentation:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loaded customer data from a CSV file and selected relevant features ('Annual Income' and 'Spending Score').
Standardized the features using StandardScaler.
Elbow Method for Optimal Cluster Number:

Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
K-means Clustering:

Applied K-means clustering with k=3 to the scaled features.
Visualization:

Plotted a scatter plot to visualize the clusters and centroids.
Cluster Assignment Display:

Displayed the cluster assignment for each customer.
